# TenKeySequences
old hw for an interview i did for getco.
the problem statement was something like generate 10 key sequences using chess night moves.
there was some additional rules.  my code solved the problem, the optimal solution was to cache all the combinations as permutations. 

com.hansoncoyne.getco.TenKeySequences is the entry point
